1,en,"What are effective ways to enhance soil fertility in organic farming systems?","Enhancing soil fertility in organic farming is crucial for sustainable crop production. The primary goal is to build a healthy soil ecosystem through compost, cover crops, crop rotation, animal manures, mulching, and bio-fertilizers.","Enhancing soil fertility in organic farming involves increasing soil organic matter via composting, manure, green manures, cover crops, crop residue retention, promoting soil biodiversity, minimizing tillage, inoculating beneficial microbes, practicing crop rotation, preventing compaction, reducing erosion, and optimizing water management.",""
2,en,"How can farmers restore nutrient-depleted soils without relying on synthetic fertilizers?","Restoring nutrient-depleted soils without synthetic fertilizers focuses on rebuilding soil health through compost, manure, cover crops, crop rotation, reduced tillage, bio-fertilizers, biochar, and rock powders.","Restoring nutrient-depleted soils without synthetic fertilizers involves increasing organic matter through compost and aged manure, leaving crop residues, using cover crops (especially legumes for nitrogen fixation), promoting earthworms and beneficial microbes, reducing tillage, rotating crops, using compost tea and biochar, and applying natural amendments like rock powders or gypsum.",""
3,en,"What techniques can be used to prevent soil erosion on sloped agricultural land?","Preventing soil erosion on slopes uses contour farming, terracing, strip cropping, no-till farming, and cover crops to slow runoff and protect soil.","Techniques include contour farming, terracing, strip cropping, cover crops and residue retention, grassed waterways, check dams, vetiver grass planting, reduced tillage, and tree/shrub shelterbelts to slow runoff, trap sediment, and stabilize soil.",""
4,en,"What are the benefits of using terracing to control erosion on hilly farmland?","Terracing reduces soil erosion, conserves water, increases arable land, improves soil health, and reduces landslide risk.","Terracing reduces water runoff velocity, increases infiltration, improves retention, prevents soil and nutrient loss, stops gully formation, enhances root penetration, increases yield potential, and improves farm management on slopes.",""
5,en,"What are some biological pest control methods for managing crop pests sustainably?","Biological pest control uses beneficial organisms (predators, parasitoids, pathogens), microbial agents, and strategies like conservation, augmentation, and classical biological control.","Biological pest control uses conservation, augmentation, and introduction of natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, pathogens), microbial control agents like Bacillus thuringiensis, entomopathogenic fungi, viruses, and behavioral methods like pheromone traps, mating disruption, repellents, push-pull strategies, and physical barriers.",""
6,en,"How can integrated pest management (IPM) reduce the environmental impact of farming?","IPM minimizes pesticide use through prevention, monitoring, and targeted control, protecting beneficial insects, biodiversity, and water and soil quality.","IPM minimizes synthetic pesticide use by prevention, monitoring, and targeted control. It protects beneficial insects, preserves biodiversity, improves soil and water quality, reduces runoff, lowers nutrient leaching, and promotes sustainable, balanced agroecosystems.",""
7,en,"What irrigation methods are most effective for improving water efficiency in dry climates?","Water-efficient irrigation includes drip irrigation, sub-surface irrigation, sprinklers with proper scheduling, mulching, and drought-tolerant crops.","Methods include subsurface drip irrigation, surface drip, micro-sprinklers, and center pivots with LEPA/LESA nozzles. Complementary practices like mulching, rainwater harvesting, drought-tolerant crops, and slope management further enhance water efficiency.",""
8,en,"What are the benefits of rainwater harvesting for improving water efficiency in agriculture?","Rainwater harvesting reduces reliance on external sources, cuts costs, improves soil and water health, and offers resilience against drought.","Rainwater harvesting reduces reliance on primary sources, replenishes soil moisture, improves water quality, reduces runoff/erosion, cuts costs, supports sustainability, offers flexible use, and aids climate change adaptation.",""
9,en,"How can agroforestry help farmers adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change?","Agroforestry moderates microclimate, improves soil health, conserves water, diversifies income, sequesters carbon, and reduces emissions.","Agroforestry moderates microclimate, conserves moisture, provides habitats, diversifies income, improves soil health, prevents erosion, enhances nutrient cycling, sequesters carbon, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and prevents deforestation.",""
10,en,"What are some crop diversification strategies to make agriculture more resilient to climate variability?","Crop diversification includes intercropping, crop rotation, agroforestry, varietal diversification, and underutilized crops to spread risk.","Strategies include crop rotation, intercropping, varietal diversification, agroforestry, growing underutilized crops, integrating livestock, and diversifying across locations to spread risk and enhance resilience.",""
11,en,"How can soil conservation practices contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of farming?","Soil conservation sequesters carbon, reduces fuel use, lowers fertilizer needs, and improves water efficiency.","Practices increase soil organic carbon via organic matter addition, reduce CO₂ emissions, lower N₂O emissions through better nitrogen management, cut methane from improved aeration, reduce fuel use by less tillage, and improve water efficiency.",""
